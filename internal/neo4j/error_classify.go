// always the whole cluster/standalone) has been deleted. Distinct from a
// transient connect failure (IsConnectivityError): a vanished DNS name will not
// come back on its own, so finalizer cleanup against it is a permanent no-op and
// the finalizer can be released immediately.
//
// Matches ONLY "no such host" — Go's rendering of an NXDOMAIN (the name does not
// exist). It deliberately excludes "temporary failure in name resolution"

// refused (pod down/restarting), connect timeout, reset, or a routing-table
// fetch failure. These are typically transient (a rolling restart, a
// not-yet-ready pod), so callers should retry rather than give up immediately.
//
// The driver's own neo4j.IsConnectivityError uses a bare type assertion, so it
// returns false once the error has been wrapped with %w (as every drop/revoke
// helper in this package does). We unwrap with errors.As so wrapped driver
// errors are still recognised, then fall back to matching the common
// network-failure substrings the driver surfaces as plain strings.

// DNS-resolution failures are deliberately excluded here — see
// IsHostUnresolvableError, which callers should check first.
