## 🆕 What's New

### Latest Features (Neo4j 5.26+ and 2025.x)
*   **Database Management**: Create databases with `IF NOT EXISTS`, `WAIT`/`NOWAIT` options
*   **🆕 Aura Fleet Management**: Monitor self-managed Neo4j deployments from the Aura console — operator installs the pre-bundled plugin and handles token registration automatically; works alongside any `Neo4jPlugin` CRDs
*   **🆕 Seed URI Functionality**: Create databases directly from existing backups stored in cloud storage
*   **🆕 Property Sharding**: Horizontal scaling for large datasets with separate graph and property shards
*   **🆕 MCP Server Support**: Optional MCP server deployment for Neo4j clusters and standalone workloads (HTTPS preferred, STDIO for in-cluster use)
*   **Topology Constraints**: Specify primary/secondary distribution for databases
*   **Version Detection**: Automatic adaptation for Neo4j 5.26.x (SemVer) and 2025.x (CalVer)
*   **CalVer Acceptance Note**: 2025.x+ (including 2026.x) is accepted by default, but new CalVer features may need operator updates for full compatibility
*   **Cypher Language**: Support for Cypher 25 in Neo4j 2025.x
*   **Backup Improvements**: FULL/DIFF/AUTO backup types, backup from secondaries
*   **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to specific timestamps with `--restore-until`
*   **Centralized Backup**: Single backup StatefulSet per cluster for resource efficiency

## 🚀 Seed URI Database Creation

Create Neo4j databases directly from existing backups stored in cloud storage - perfect for migrations, disaster recovery, and environment setup.

### Quick Example

```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jDatabase
metadata:
  name: migrated-production-db
spec:
  clusterRef: production-cluster
  name: production

  # Create from S3 backup with point-in-time recovery
  seedURI: "s3://my-neo4j-backups/production-2025-01-15.backup"
  seedConfig:
    restoreUntil: "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"  # Neo4j 2025.x only
    config:
      compression: "gzip"
      validation: "strict"

  # Database topology
  topology:
    primaries: 2
    secondaries: 2

  wait: true
  ifNotExists: true
```

### Supported Features

*   **☁️ Multi-Cloud Support**: S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
*   **🌐 HTTP/FTP**: Support for HTTP/HTTPS and FTP sources
*   **🔒 Flexible Authentication**: System-wide (IAM roles, workload identity) or explicit credentials
*   **⏰ Point-in-Time Recovery**: Restore to specific timestamps (Neo4j 2025.x)
*   **📊 Topology Control**: Specify database distribution across cluster servers
*   **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Support for .backup format with compression options
