# Migration Guide: Neo4j Kubernetes Operator

This guide helps you migrate from previous versions of the Neo4j Kubernetes Operator to the latest version with the new CRD structure.

## Overview of Changes

The Neo4j Kubernetes Operator now separates single-node and clustered deployments into two distinct CRDs:

- **`Neo4jEnterpriseCluster`**: For clustered deployments requiring high availability
- **`Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone`**: For single-node deployments in single mode

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### 1. Single-Node Clusters No Longer Supported

**Previous behavior** (no longer supported):
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: single-node-cluster
spec:
  topology:
    servers: 1
```

**New behavior** - Choose one of these options:

**Option A: Migrate to Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone** (recommended for development/testing):
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone
metadata:
  name: single-node-standalone
spec:
  # Same configuration as before, but without topology
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: "5.26-enterprise"
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: "10Gi"
  # ... other configuration
```

**Option B: Migrate to Minimal Cluster** (recommended for production):
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: minimal-cluster
spec:
  topology:
    servers: 2  # Minimum required
  # ... other configuration
```

### 2. Minimum Cluster Topology Requirements

`Neo4jEnterpriseCluster` now enforces minimum topology requirements:

- **Minimum**: 2 servers (self-organize into primary/secondary roles)
- **Recommended**: 3+ servers for production fault tolerance

**Invalid configurations** (will fail validation):
```yaml
# ❌ This will fail validation
topology:
  servers: 1
```

**Valid configurations**:
```yaml
# ✅ Minimum cluster topology
topology:
  servers: 2

# ✅ Larger cluster
topology:
  servers: 5
```

### 3. Discovery Mode Changes

All Neo4j 5.26+ deployments now use `V2_ONLY` discovery mode automatically. You no longer need to configure this manually.

## Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Single-Node Development Environment

**Before**:
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: dev-neo4j
spec:
  topology:
    servers: 1
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: "5.26-enterprise"
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: "10Gi"
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
  tls:
    mode: disabled
```

**After**:
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone
metadata:
  name: dev-neo4j
spec:
  # Remove topology field
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: "5.26-enterprise"
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: "10Gi"
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
  tls:
    mode: disabled
```

### Scenario 2: Production Single-Node → Minimal Cluster

**Before**:
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-neo4j
spec:
  topology:
    servers: 1
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: "5.26-enterprise"
  storage:
    className: fast-ssd
    size: "50Gi"
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "4Gi"
      cpu: "2"
  tls:
    mode: cert-manager
    issuerRef:
      name: prod-issuer
      kind: ClusterIssuer
```

**After**:
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-neo4j
spec:
  topology:
    servers: 2  # Minimum cluster topology
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: "5.26-enterprise"
  storage:
    className: fast-ssd
    size: "50Gi"
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "4Gi"
      cpu: "2"
  tls:
    mode: cert-manager
    issuerRef:
      name: prod-issuer
      kind: ClusterIssuer
```

### Scenario 3: Existing Multi-Node Clusters

**No changes required** - existing multi-node clusters will continue to work as before:

```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-cluster
spec:
  topology:
    servers: 5
  # ... rest of configuration unchanged
```

## Step-by-Step Migration Process

### 1. Assessment Phase

First, identify what you currently have:

```bash
# List all existing clusters
kubectl get neo4jenterprisecluster -A

# Check topology of each cluster
kubectl get neo4jenterprisecluster -A -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,SERVERS:.spec.topology.servers
```

### 2. Backup Your Data

Before making any changes, create backups:

```bash
# Create backup for each cluster
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jBackup
metadata:
  name: migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
  namespace: <your-namespace>
spec:
  target:
    kind: Cluster
    name: <your-cluster-name>
  storage:
    type: pvc
    pvc:
      name: migration-backup-pvc
      storageClassName: standard
      size: 50Gi
EOF
```

### 3. Migration Strategy A: In-Place Migration (Minimal Downtime)

For clusters that need to stay clustered:

1. **Update the cluster topology**:
   ```bash
   kubectl patch neo4jenterprisecluster <cluster-name> -p '{"spec":{"topology":{"servers":2}}}'
   ```

2. **Wait for the additional server to be ready**:
   ```bash
   kubectl wait neo4jenterprisecluster <cluster-name> --for=condition=Ready --timeout=600s
   ```

3. **Verify the cluster is healthy**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get neo4jenterprisecluster <cluster-name> -o yaml
   ```

### 4. Migration Strategy B: Blue-Green Migration (Zero Downtime)

For production environments requiring zero downtime:

1. **Create new deployment** with correct topology:
   ```bash
   # Create new cluster with minimum topology
   kubectl apply -f new-cluster.yaml
   ```

2. **Wait for new cluster to be ready**:
   ```bash
   kubectl wait neo4jenterprisecluster <new-cluster-name> --for=condition=Ready --timeout=600s
   ```

3. **Restore data to new cluster**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f restore-to-new-cluster.yaml
   ```

4. **Update application connections**:
   ```bash
   # Update your application's connection string
   # From: bolt://old-cluster-client:7687
   # To: bolt://new-cluster-client:7687
   ```

5. **Remove old cluster**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete neo4jenterprisecluster <old-cluster-name>
   ```

### 5. Migration Strategy C: Single-Node to Standalone

For development/testing environments:

1. **Create standalone deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f standalone-deployment.yaml
   ```

2. **Wait for standalone to be ready**:
   ```bash
   kubectl wait neo4jenterprisestandalone <standalone-name> --for=condition=Ready --timeout=300s
   ```

3. **Migrate data** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Export data from old cluster
   kubectl exec -it <old-cluster-pod> -- neo4j-admin dump --to=/tmp/export.dump

   # Import data to standalone
   kubectl exec -it <standalone-pod> -- neo4j-admin load --from=/tmp/export.dump
   ```

4. **Update application connections**:
   ```bash
   # Update connection string to standalone service
   ```

5. **Remove old cluster**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete neo4jenterprisecluster <old-cluster-name>
   ```

## Configuration Migration

### Environment Variables

No changes required - environment variables work the same way in both CRDs.

### Custom Configuration

**Neo4jEnterpriseCluster**:
- Clustering configurations are automatically set
- V2_ONLY discovery is automatically configured
- User configurations are merged with cluster defaults

**Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone**:
- Uses unified clustering infrastructure with single member (Neo4j 5.26+)
- Fixed at 1 replica, clustering scale-out is not supported
- User configurations are merged with standalone defaults

### TLS Configuration

No changes required - TLS configuration works the same way in both CRDs.

### Authentication

No changes required - authentication configuration works the same way in both CRDs.

## Validation and Testing

### 1. Validate New Deployments

```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get neo4jenterprisecluster
kubectl get neo4jenterprisestandalone

# Check pod status
# Clusters
kubectl get pods -l neo4j.com/cluster=<cluster-name>
# Standalone
kubectl get pods -l app=<standalone-name>

# Check service endpoints
kubectl get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/name=neo4j
```

### 2. Test Connectivity

```bash
# Test cluster connectivity
kubectl port-forward svc/<cluster-name>-client 7474:7474 7687:7687

# Test standalone connectivity
kubectl port-forward svc/<standalone-name>-service 7474:7474 7687:7687

# Test with Neo4j Browser
open http://localhost:7474
```

### 3. Verify Data Integrity

```bash
# Connect to Neo4j and run basic queries
cypher-shell -u neo4j -p <password> -a bolt://localhost:7687

# Run test queries
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n) as nodeCount;
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r) as relationshipCount;
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Validation Errors

**Error**: `Neo4jEnterpriseCluster requires minimum cluster topology`

**Solution**: Either add another server or migrate to `Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone`:

```bash
# Option 1: Add server
kubectl patch neo4jenterprisecluster <name> -p '{"spec":{"topology":{"servers":2}}}'

# Option 2: Migrate to standalone
kubectl apply -f standalone-replacement.yaml
```

### Issue 2: Pod Restart Loops

**Error**: Pods restarting due to discovery configuration

**Solution**: Ensure you're using Neo4j 5.26+ and let the operator handle discovery configuration automatically.

### Issue 3: Connection Issues

**Error**: Applications can't connect to new endpoints

**Solution**: Update application connection strings:

```bash
# For clusters
# Old: bolt://single-node-cluster-client:7687
# New: bolt://minimal-cluster-client:7687

# For standalone
# Old: bolt://single-node-cluster-client:7687
# New: bolt://standalone-neo4j-service:7687
```

### Issue 4: Storage Migration

**Error**: Storage not accessible after migration

**Solution**: Ensure PVCs are properly preserved:

```bash
# Check PVC status
# Clusters
kubectl get pvc -l neo4j.com/cluster=<cluster-name>
# Standalone
kubectl get pvc neo4j-data-<standalone-name>-0

# If needed, manually migrate data
kubectl exec -it <old-pod> -- neo4j-admin dump --to=/tmp/migration.dump
kubectl cp <old-pod>:/tmp/migration.dump ./migration.dump
kubectl cp ./migration.dump <new-pod>:/tmp/migration.dump
kubectl exec -it <new-pod> -- neo4j-admin load --from=/tmp/migration.dump
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Rollback from Cluster to Single-Node

If you need to rollback a cluster migration:

1. **Create backup** of current cluster
2. **Deploy old single-node configuration** (if supported in your operator version)
3. **Restore data** from backup
4. **Update application connections**

### Rollback from Standalone to Cluster

If you need to rollback a standalone migration:

1. **Create backup** of standalone deployment
2. **Deploy new cluster** with minimum topology
3. **Restore data** to cluster
4. **Update application connections**

## Best Practices

1. **Always backup** before migration
2. **Test in staging** environment first
3. **Use blue-green deployment** for zero downtime
4. **Monitor during migration** for issues
5. **Update monitoring** and alerting for new endpoints
6. **Document changes** for your team
7. **Plan rollback procedures** in advance

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=neo4j-operator
   kubectl logs -l neo4j.com/cluster=<cluster-name>
   kubectl logs -l app=<standalone-name>
   ```

2. **Check status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe neo4jenterprisecluster <name>
   kubectl describe neo4jenterprisestandalone <name>
   ```

3. **Community support**:

## Upgrading from v1.9.x to the next release (Unreleased)

This section covers the breaking and behavioural changes on `main` since `v1.9.0`. Replace the heading with the actual version when the next release is tagged.

### 1. Removed spec fields (CRD validation will reject manifests using them)

Four typed fields that were defined on the schema but were never wired through to Neo4j config have been removed. Manifests still using these fields will be rejected by CRD validation with `unknown field` errors:

| Removed field | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `Neo4jEnterpriseCluster.spec.auth.jwt` (also: `JWTAuthSpec`, `JWTValidationSpec` types) | Use the `oidc-<name>` typed providers under `spec.auth.oidc` — Neo4j ID tokens are JWTs, so OIDC covers the JWT use case end-to-end. |
| `Neo4jEnterpriseCluster.spec.ui` and `Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone.spec.ui` (`UISpec` type) | Neo4j Browser is bundled in the Enterprise image. Expose it via the existing `spec.service.ingress` block (or your own ingress / route). The typed `UISpec` block was a no-op. |
| `Neo4jEnterpriseCluster.spec.restoreFrom` and `Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone.spec.restoreFrom` (`RestoreSpec` inline type) | Use the `Neo4jRestore` CR. Apply the cluster/standalone first, wait for `status.phase=Ready`, then apply a `Neo4jRestore` referencing the backup. The migration-from-cluster-to-standalone example in the standalone API reference shows the canonical flow. |
| `Neo4jPlugin.spec.license` (`PluginLicense` type) | Mount license files via `spec.extraVolumes` + `spec.extraVolumeMounts` on the cluster/standalone CR, then reference the mount path from `spec.config` (e.g. `gds.enterprise.license_file: /licenses/gds.license`). |

**Action**: grep your manifests for these fields and migrate before upgrading the operator:

```bash
grep -rE 'spec:.*\b(jwt|ui|restoreFrom|license):' path/to/manifests/
```

### 2. `spec.auth.passwordPolicy` and `spec.auth.kerberos` are now documented as schema-only

These typed blocks remain on the CRD for back-compat — manifests carrying them will not be rejected — but the operator does **not** wire them through to Neo4j config and never has. Earlier docs implied otherwise.

**Action**: until typed-field support is implemented, set the equivalent Neo4j config keys directly in `spec.config`:

```yaml
spec:
  auth:
    adminSecret: neo4j-admin-secret
    # spec.auth.passwordPolicy is schema-only and ignored — set the Neo4j
    # keys directly until typed-field support lands.
  config:
    dbms.security.auth_minimum_password_length: "12"
    # Kerberos: dbms.security.kerberos.* keys here, plus a keytab volume
    # mounted via spec.extraVolumes / spec.extraVolumeMounts.
```

### 3. `neo4j_operator_cluster_replicas_total` metric: role label values renamed

The Prometheus gauge that exposes server counts had its `role` label values renamed:

| Before | After | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `role="primary"` | `role="desired"` | `spec.topology.servers` |
| `role="secondary"` | `role="ready"` | StatefulSet `readyReplicas` |

The original `primary` / `secondary` shape was inherited from a pre-server-architecture design. Neo4j 5.26+ uses a single `{cluster}-server` StatefulSet where roles are assigned at runtime via `serverModeConstraint`; the old labels were structurally meaningless and the call site was hardcoding `secondaries=0` regardless of cluster state. Per-server primary/secondary state is exposed separately via `neo4j_operator_server_health` (populated from `SHOW SERVERS` when monitoring is enabled).

**Action**: update PromQL queries / Grafana dashboards filtering on the old labels:

```promql
# Before
neo4j_operator_cluster_replicas_total{role="primary"}

# After
neo4j_operator_cluster_replicas_total{role="desired"}
```

### 4. Env-var removals from `spec.config` now actually take effect

Previously, removing a key from `spec.config` did not remove the corresponding `NEO4J_*` env var from the live StatefulSet — the cluster controller's `envVarsEqual` was a one-directional subset check that didn't detect "name dropped from desired". Pods continued running with the stale setting until something else triggered a template-replacing restart.

The fix tracks the cluster controller's owned env-var names in a `neo4j.com/cluster-controller-env-vars` annotation on the StatefulSet; on each reconcile, names previously owned but no longer in desired are dropped from the live env array, while foreign env vars (added by the plugin / fleet-management / Aura controllers) are preserved as before.

**Action**: this is generally the behaviour users expected. But if any cluster has been silently relying on a stale env var sticking around after the corresponding `spec.config` key was removed, that env var will disappear on the next reconcile after the upgrade — and then on the next pod restart, Neo4j will boot without that setting. Audit your `spec.config` entries before upgrading if your cluster has a long history of key edits.

**Behind the scenes**: the annotation is bootstrapped on the next reconcile after the upgrade — `previousOwned` is empty on first read, so no spurious removals happen. From that reconcile onward the set is tracked.

### Quick upgrade checklist

1. Grep manifests for the removed fields (step 1) and migrate them.
2. If you set `spec.auth.passwordPolicy` or `spec.auth.kerberos` and were depending on it doing something, move the equivalent keys into `spec.config` (step 2).
3. Update PromQL / Grafana queries on `cluster_replicas_total` (step 3).
4. Audit `spec.config` if you have long-edit-history clusters that may have relied on the env-var-removal bug (step 4).

## Upgrading to v1.7.0-alpha (API Version Bump to v1beta1)

v1.7.0-alpha graduates the API from `v1alpha1` to `v1beta1`, signaling field stability. The API schema is unchanged — only the version identifier changes. Additionally, TLS bolt enforcement and standalone health probes are introduced.

### API version change

All manifests must update their `apiVersion` field:

```yaml
# Before (v1.6.0-alpha and earlier)
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1alpha1

# After (v1.7.0-alpha)
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
```

This applies to **all** operator CRDs:
- `Neo4jEnterpriseCluster`
- `Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone`
- `Neo4jDatabase`
- `Neo4jBackup`
- `Neo4jRestore`
- `Neo4jPlugin`
- `Neo4jShardedDatabase`

### Bolt TLS enforcement

When TLS is enabled (`tls.mode: cert-manager`), the operator now sets `server.bolt.tls_level=REQUIRED` on both cluster and standalone deployments. Previously this was `OPTIONAL`, meaning plain `bolt://` connections were silently accepted even with TLS configured.

**Action required** if you have clients connecting via plain `bolt://` to TLS-enabled deployments:
- Update connection strings from `bolt://` to `bolt+s://` (with CA verification) or `bolt+ssc://` (self-signed certs)
- Update `cypher-shell` commands to use `-a bolt+ssc://host:7687`
- Update application driver configurations to enable TLS

### Deprecated configuration key

`dbms.logs.query.enabled` is now flagged as deprecated by the config validator. Replace with `db.logs.query.enabled` in your `spec.config` sections.

### Standalone health probes

Standalone deployments now include readiness, liveness, and startup probes using `/conf/health.sh`. This means:
- Pods are no longer marked Ready until Neo4j is actually accepting connections
- The `status.phase` transition to `Ready` now reflects true Neo4j readiness
- Existing deployments will see a rolling update when the operator is upgraded (new probe spec on the StatefulSet)

### Quick upgrade checklist

1. Update all manifests: `apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1alpha1` → `apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1`
2. Apply updated CRDs before deploying the new operator version:
   ```bash
   # If using Helm
   helm upgrade neo4j-operator ./charts/neo4j-operator --namespace neo4j-operator-system

   # If using make targets
   make install   # Updates CRDs
   make deploy-prod  # or deploy-dev
   ```
3. If TLS is enabled, update client connection strings from `bolt://` to `bolt+s://` or `bolt+ssc://`
4. Replace `dbms.logs.query.enabled` with `db.logs.query.enabled` in `spec.config`
5. Expect a one-time rolling restart of standalone pods (new health probes added to StatefulSet)

### Batch update with sed

```bash
# Update all YAML manifests in your deployment directory
find /path/to/manifests -name '*.yaml' -exec \
  sed -i 's|neo4j.neo4j.com/v1alpha1|neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1|g' {} +

# Update deprecated config key
find /path/to/manifests -name '*.yaml' -exec \
  sed -i 's|dbms.logs.query.enabled|db.logs.query.enabled|g' {} +
```

---

## Upgrading to v1.6.0-alpha (API Stabilization)

v1.6.0-alpha included breaking changes to the `v1alpha1` API to stabilize fields ahead of the v1beta1 graduation (completed in v1.7.0-alpha). These changes fixed field naming inconsistencies, removed deprecated fields, and resolved bugs.

### Field renames

| Resource | Old Field | New Field | Action |
|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| `Neo4jRestore` | `spec.targetCluster` | `spec.clusterRef` | Rename in YAML |
| Auth TrustStore | `spec.auth.trustStore.secretRef` | `spec.auth.trustStore.name` | Rename in YAML |
| Kerberos Keytab | `spec.auth.kerberos.keytab.secretRef` | `spec.auth.kerberos.keytab.name` | Rename in YAML |

Example — before:
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jRestore
spec:
  targetCluster: my-cluster
  databaseName: neo4j
  source:
    type: backup
    backupRef: daily-backup
```

After:
```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1beta1
kind: Neo4jRestore
spec:
  clusterRef: my-cluster
  databaseName: neo4j
  source:
    type: backup
    backupRef: daily-backup
```

### Removed fields

| Field | Replacement |
|-------|-------------|
| `spec.auth.provider` | `spec.auth.authenticationProviders` (list) |
| `spec.auth.secretRef` | Use provider-specific typed configs (`spec.auth.ldap`, `spec.auth.oidc`, etc.) |
| `spec.persistence` (standalone) | `spec.storage.retentionPolicy` (already present on StorageSpec) |
| `spec.route` (standalone top-level) | `spec.service.route` (matching cluster pattern) |

Example — migrating deprecated auth fields:

Before:
```yaml
spec:
  auth:
    provider: ldap
    secretRef: ldap-config
```

After:
```yaml
spec:
  auth:
    authenticationProviders: ["ldap"]
    authorizationProviders: ["ldap"]
    ldap:
      host: "ldap://ldap.example.com:389"
      authentication:
        userDNTemplate: "uid={0},ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
```

Example — migrating standalone persistence:

Before:
```yaml
spec:
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: "10Gi"
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    retentionPolicy: Delete
    accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
```

After:
```yaml
spec:
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: "10Gi"
    retentionPolicy: Delete
```

Example — migrating standalone route:

Before:
```yaml
spec:
  route:
    enabled: true
    host: neo4j.apps.example.com
```

After:
```yaml
spec:
  service:
    type: ClusterIP
    route:
      enabled: true
      host: neo4j.apps.example.com
```

### Encryption algorithm rename

If you use backup encryption with ChaCha20, update the algorithm name:

| Old Value | New Value |
|-----------|-----------|
| `ChaCha20` | `ChaCha20Poly1305` |

### Unified secret reference type

`TrustStoreSpec`, `AuraTokenSecretRef`, and `KerberosKeytabSpec` have been replaced by a single `SecretKeyRef` type with `name` and `key` fields. The JSON structure for `AuraFleetManagement.tokenSecretRef` is unchanged (fields were already `name`/`key`). For `trustStore` and `kerberos.keytab`, the `secretRef` field is now `name`.

### Quick upgrade checklist

1. Search your manifests for `targetCluster:` and replace with `clusterRef:`
2. Search for `auth.provider:` / `auth.secretRef:` and migrate to `authenticationProviders`/`authorizationProviders` with typed provider configs
3. Search standalone manifests for `spec.route:` and move to `spec.service.route:`
4. Search standalone manifests for `spec.persistence:` and move retention policy to `spec.storage.retentionPolicy:`
5. Search for `trustStore.secretRef:` and rename to `trustStore.name:`
6. Search for `kerberos.keytab.secretRef:` and rename to `kerberos.keytab.name:`
7. If using `algorithm: ChaCha20` in backup encryption, change to `algorithm: ChaCha20Poly1305`
8. Apply updated CRDs before deploying the new operator version

## What's Next

After completing your migration:

1. **Update monitoring** dashboards and alerts
2. **Update documentation** and runbooks
3. **Train your team** on the new CRD structure
4. **Consider proper resource configuration** for cluster deployments
5. **Implement proper backup** strategies for your deployment type
