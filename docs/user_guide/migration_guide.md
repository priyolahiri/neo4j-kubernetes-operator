# Upgrade Guide

**v1.13.0 is the first public release of this independent project.** There is no
upgrade path from earlier version numbers — install v1.13.0 fresh (see the
[Installation guide](installation.md)).

> This is a personally maintained, community project with no affiliation to
> Neo4j, Inc. APIs and behaviour **may change between releases** — review the
> release notes before upgrading, and validate independently before relying on
> a new version.

## v1.14 — backup & restore API cleanup (breaking)

v1.14 removes the deprecated `Neo4jBackup` / `Neo4jRestore` fields that v1.13
kept working behind deprecation warnings. `v1beta1` is still a beta API, so these
are removed in place rather than versioned. **Update your `Neo4jBackup` and
`Neo4jRestore` manifests before upgrading** — the removed fields are silently
dropped by the API server (they're no longer in the CRD schema), which would
otherwise leave a backup/restore mis-scoped or unconfirmed.

Nothing else changes: cluster, standalone, database, user/role, and plugin CRs
are untouched.

### `Neo4jBackup`

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `spec.target.{kind,name,clusterRef}` | `spec.instanceRef` + exactly one of `spec.database` / `spec.allDatabases` / `spec.shardedDatabase` |
| `spec.cloud` (top-level) | `spec.storage.cloud` |
| `spec.options.verify` | *(removed — it was never wired to `neo4j-admin backup validate`; use `spec.options.validate`)* |
| `spec.retention.deletePolicy: Archive` | `Delete` (the only supported value; `Archive` never had archival logic) |

```yaml
# BEFORE (v1.13)                          # AFTER (v1.14)
spec:                                     spec:
  target:                                   instanceRef: my-cluster
    kind: Cluster                           allDatabases: true
    name: my-cluster                        storage:
  cloud:                                       type: s3
    provider: aws                              bucket: backups
  storage:                                     cloud:
    type: s3                                     provider: aws
    bucket: backups
```

Scope mapping: `kind: Cluster` → `allDatabases: true`; `kind: Database` (with
`name: db`, `clusterRef: c`) → `instanceRef: c` + `database: db`;
`kind: ShardedDatabase` (with `name: sd`, `clusterRef: c`) → `instanceRef: c` +
`shardedDatabase: sd`.

### `Neo4jRestore`

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| `spec.clusterRef` | `spec.instanceRef` |
| `spec.databaseName` | `spec.database` |
| `spec.force` | `spec.options.replaceExisting: true` |
| `spec.verifyBackup` | *(removed — it was never implemented)* |

```yaml
# BEFORE (v1.13)                          # AFTER (v1.14)
spec:                                     spec:
  clusterRef: my-cluster                    instanceRef: my-cluster
  databaseName: orders                      database: orders
  force: true                               options:
  source:                                     replaceExisting: true
    type: backup                            source:
    backupRef: nightly                        type: backup
                                              backupRef: nightly
```

Also new in v1.14 (additive, no action needed): `Neo4jRestore.status.stats.duration`
and `status.backupInfo` are now populated on a successful restore.

## Upgrading between future releases

When a newer version ships:

1. **Refresh the CRDs first.** Helm does not upgrade CRDs automatically, so a new
   field or validation won't take effect until the CRDs are applied. Apply the
   bundle for the version you are upgrading to (replace the tag):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --server-side -f \
     https://github.com/priyolahiri/neo4j-kubernetes-operator/releases/download/v1.13.0/neo4j-kubernetes-operator.yaml
   ```

2. **Upgrade the operator** via Helm:

   ```bash
   helm repo update
   helm upgrade neo4j-operator neo4j-operator/neo4j-operator \
     --namespace neo4j-operator-system
   ```

   (or re-apply the complete bundle if you installed with plain `kubectl` —
   see the [Installation guide](installation.md)).

3. **Read the release notes** for that version for any breaking changes or
   manual steps, and roll forward one minor version at a time if you are
   skipping several.

The operator reconciles declaratively, so once the new version is running it
converges existing `Neo4j*` resources to the new behaviour automatically.
