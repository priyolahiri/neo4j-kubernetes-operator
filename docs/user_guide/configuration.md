# Configuration

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the configuration options available for both `Neo4jEnterpriseCluster` and `Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone` custom resources. The operator allows for a declarative approach to managing your Neo4j deployments, where you define the desired state in a YAML file, and the operator works to make it a reality.

## CRD Specification

The full CRD specifications, which detail every possible configuration field, can be found in the API Reference:
- [Neo4jEnterpriseCluster](../api_reference/neo4jenterprisecluster.md) - For clustered deployments
- [Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone](../api_reference/neo4jenterprisestandalone.md) - For single-node deployments

## Key Configuration Fields

Below are some of the most important fields you will use to configure your cluster. For a complete list, please consult the API reference.

*   `spec.image`: The Neo4j Docker image to use. Requires Neo4j Enterprise 5.26+ or 2025.x. You can specify the repository (e.g., `neo4j`), tag (e.g., `5.26-enterprise`), and pull policy.
*   `spec.topology`: (Cluster only) Defines the architecture of your cluster. Specify the total number of servers (minimum 2) that will self-organize into primary and secondary roles based on database requirements. You can optionally configure server role constraints.
*   `spec.storage`: Configures the persistent storage for the cluster, including storage class and size.
*   `spec.auth`: Manages authentication, allowing you to specify the provider (native, LDAP, etc.) and the secret containing credentials.
*   `spec.resources`: Allows you to set specific CPU and memory requests and limits for the Neo4j pods, which is crucial for performance tuning.
*   `spec.backups`: (Deprecated) Use the separate Neo4jBackup CRD for backup management. The operator now uses a centralized backup StatefulSet for resource efficiency.
*   `spec.queryMonitoring`: Enable query monitoring and Prometheus metrics exposure.

> **Live Diagnostics:** When `enabled: true` and the cluster is `Ready`, the operator
> automatically runs `SHOW SERVERS` and `SHOW DATABASES` and writes results to
> `status.diagnostics`. Two new conditions, `ServersHealthy` and `DatabasesHealthy`,
> reflect cluster health without requiring `kubectl exec`. See the
> [Monitoring Guide](guides/monitoring.md#live-cluster-diagnostics) for full details.

*   **Plugin management**: Use separate Neo4jPlugin CRDs to install plugins like APOC, GDS, Bloom, GenAI, and N10s. The operator automatically handles Neo4j 5.26+ compatibility requirements (see [Neo4jPlugin API Reference](../api_reference/neo4jplugin.md)).
*   `spec.mcp`: Optional Neo4j MCP server deployment for client integrations (HTTP or STDIO). Requires the APOC plugin via Neo4jPlugin; HTTP uses per-request auth and supports Service/Ingress/Route exposure with optional TLS.
*   `spec.tls`: Configure TLS/SSL encryption. Set mode to `cert-manager` and provide an issuerRef for automatic certificate management.
*   `spec.config`: Add custom Neo4j configuration settings as key-value pairs. These are added to neo4j.conf.
*   `spec.env`: Add environment variables to Neo4j pods. Note that NEO4J_AUTH and NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT are managed by the operator.
*   `spec.service`: Configure service type (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer), annotations, and external access settings (Ingress; OpenShift Route).
*   `spec.propertySharding`: (Neo4j 2025.12+) Enable property sharding for horizontal scaling of large datasets. See the [Property Sharding Guide](property_sharding.md) for detailed configuration options.

## MCP Server

The operator can deploy an optional Neo4j MCP server alongside a cluster or standalone deployment. It uses the **official `mcp/neo4j` image** ([Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mcp/neo4j), [source](https://github.com/neo4j/mcp)) — the supported Neo4j product MCP server.

The MCP server runs as a separate Deployment and connects to the Neo4j service inside the namespace.
For client configuration and HTTP/STDIO usage, see the [MCP Client Setup Guide](guides/mcp_client_setup.md).

### Requirements

*   **APOC**: MCP requires APOC for the `get-schema` tool. Install APOC using the Neo4jPlugin CRD (see [Neo4jPlugin API Reference](../api_reference/neo4jplugin.md)).
*   **Image**: If `spec.mcp.image` is omitted the operator defaults to `mcp/neo4j:latest`. Pin a version with `spec.mcp.image.tag`.

### Transport Modes

*   **HTTP (default)**: No static credentials in the MCP pod. Each client request carries a Basic Auth or Bearer token `Authorization` header; the server uses those credentials to connect to Neo4j per-request. The operator creates a Service (`<name>-mcp:8080`) and optionally an Ingress or OpenShift Route. The endpoint path is `/mcp` (fixed).
    *   **Benefits**: per-request auth, multi-user, works well with desktop clients (Claude Desktop, VSCode).
*   **STDIO (in-cluster only)**: The operator injects `NEO4J_USERNAME` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` from the admin secret (or a custom secret via `spec.mcp.auth`). No Service/Ingress/Route is created. Use for in-cluster automation.

### TLS for HTTP

The official image supports container-level TLS. Provide a Kubernetes TLS secret via `spec.mcp.http.tls.secretName`; the operator mounts it and sets `NEO4J_MCP_HTTP_TLS_ENABLED=true`.

Default ports: `8080` (no TLS) or `8443` (with TLS). Override with `spec.mcp.http.port`.

> **Tip**: For most deployments, terminate TLS at the Ingress layer and leave `spec.mcp.http.tls` unset.

### Example: Cluster MCP (HTTP)

```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1alpha1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseCluster
metadata:
  name: graph-prod
spec:
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: 2025.01.0-enterprise
  topology:
    servers: 3
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: 50Gi
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    # image defaults to mcp/neo4j:latest — no need to specify
    transport: http
    readOnly: true
    http:
      service:
        type: ClusterIP
```

### Example: Cluster MCP (HTTP with Ingress)

```yaml
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    transport: http
    readOnly: true
    http:
      service:
        type: ClusterIP
        ingress:
          enabled: true
          host: neo4j-mcp.example.com
          className: nginx
          tlsSecretName: neo4j-mcp-tls
```

### Example: Standalone MCP (STDIO)

```yaml
apiVersion: neo4j.neo4j.com/v1alpha1
kind: Neo4jEnterpriseStandalone
metadata:
  name: graph-dev
spec:
  image:
    repo: neo4j
    tag: 5.26.0-enterprise
  storage:
    className: standard
    size: 10Gi
  auth:
    adminSecret: neo4j-admin-secret
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    transport: stdio
    # auth defaults to the cluster admin secret; override if needed:
    # auth:
    #   secretName: my-readonly-user
```
